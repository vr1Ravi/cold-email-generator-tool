# Cold Mail Generator (Ongoing)

This is an AI-powered cold email generator built using Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit. Users provide the URL of a company’s careers page, and the system extracts job listings from it. Based on the job requirements, it generates personalized cold emails and includes relevant portfolio links retrieved from a vector database.

Example:
Google is hiring a Software Development Engineer (SDE). Instead of manually applying, an individual developer can use this tool to generate a tailored cold email that highlights their most relevant projects and skills, increasing their chances of getting noticed.
